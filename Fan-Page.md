     Wardell Stephen Curry II, also known as Steph Curry, is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. He plays the point guard position, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time.(NBA) to championships in 2014–15, 2016–17, and 2017–18 and to the best regular-season record in league history (73–9) in 2015–16.

Curry grew up immersed in basketball as the son of 16-year NBA veteran sharpshooter Dell Curry. The younger Curry learned the intricacies of the game from his father. His keen shooting and high “basketball IQ” were not enough to persuade college coaches to overlook his wiry frame and unremarkable 6-foot (1.8-metre) height
